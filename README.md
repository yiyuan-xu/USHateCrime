## Description of Project USHateCrime

Hate crime is always a controversial and topical problem in the US. In this project, we collect data from websites such as FBI's UCR program and KFF to visually give some background information of 2019's hate crime data in the US and study possible correlations of different socioeconomic factors with hate crime in that year. In addition, we explore 2010-2019's hate crime data in order to find some trends of US hate crime.
