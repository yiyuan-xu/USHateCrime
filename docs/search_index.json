According to an FBI report, the incidents about hate crimes rose to the highest level in more than a decade This shows that hate crime has increasingly become a serious social problem in the United States. Compared with other crimes, hate crime is more special because it distinguishes on the basis of motives. By the definition of FBI, hate crime is criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity. The purpose of our project is to use the data about hate crime provided by FBI to study some characteristics of hate crime in the United States, such as motivation, location type, offenders, trends in the recent decade, and so on. In addition, we will collect some socioeconomic factors data and compare the hate crime rate of each state to study the possible impacts of different factors on hate crime. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Sources of data 2.2 Data definition 2.3 The limitations of data", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Sources of data Hate Crime (2010-2019): The main source data we used is from the official website of FBI’s UCR Program which generates reliable crime statistics. It contains data of hate crimes in the United States over the past decades. In another table, we select the hate crime data in 2019(the latest one) as cross-sectional data to study the composition of hate crime and possible influencing factors. This dataset collects details about offenders’ bias motivation associated with 13 offense types already being reported to the UCR Program: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, aggravated assault, simple assault, intimidation, human trafficking—commercial sex acts, and human trafficking—involuntary servitude (crimes against persons); and robbery, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, arson, and destruction/damage/vandalism (crimes against property) in each state. Socioeconomic factors (2019) [Median Income, Citizenship, Race/Ethnicity, Unemployment, Political Party]: We obtain part of socioeconomic factors we think that may have impacts on hate crimes from Kaiser Family Foundation’s website. This website is a nonprofit organization focusing on national health issues, as well as the U.S. role in global health policy. We use data on population demographics and wealth including breakdowns by median annual household income, citizenship status, race/ethnicity (proportion of white), unemployment rates and political party (governor political affiliation). Education (2019): The educational data is obtained from World Population Review website. It has a table of educational attainment rate over both “High school or higher” and “Bachelors or higher” categories for all states. Income (2010-2019): Since the Kaiser Family Foundation’s website only has median household income data for 2019, we collected historical income data from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). This is a database maintained by the Research division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis that has more than 765,000 economic time series from 96 sources. We collected income data for year between 2010 and 2019. 2.2 Data definition Bias Motivation file Bias_Motivation[char]: the specific type of bias motivation.

Median_Income[numeric]: median income in each state in dollars. Year[date]: the year of report. 2.3 The limitations of data It remains unclear how comprehensive UCR’s data is since data is submitted voluntarily. Some data in UCR’s publication may not be comparable to those in prior editions of Hate Crime Statistics because of differing levels of participation from year to year. Most of the data is presented in the overall statistical data of each state, which may ignore some detailed features, and it also makes us seem to have very few observational data. For race/ethnicity in factor part, we just consider two types which are white and non-white. Political party for each state here is only determined by the governor’s political affiliation.

Since the goal of all these data files is simply to show their content, we do not do much transformation on them. 3.1.1 Bias Motivation Data Since this data file is used to show types of bias motivations and the corresponding values of hate crime cases, we simply download the excel file of the source data, delete useless columns, and finally convert it into csv. The columns we keep from raw data are: Bias_Motivation Incidents Category ## Bias_motivation Incidents Category ## 1 Anti-White 666 Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry ## 2 Anti-Black or African American 1930 Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry ## 3 Anti-American Indian or Alaska Native 119 Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry ## 4 Anti-Asian 158 Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry ## 5 Anti-Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 21 Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry ## 6 Anti-Multiple Races, Group 134 Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry 3.1.2 Location Data The source data have many columns including one column of location type and one column of total incidents happened in the corresponding type of location. We download the excel file of the source data, delete other columns, keep the two columns described before and then transform the file into a csv file. The columns we use from raw data are: Location Total incidents (renamed as Num in our file) ## Location Num ## 1 Abandoned/condemned structure 11 ## 2 Air/bus/train terminal 113 ## 3 Amusement park 5 ## 4 Arena/stadium/fairgrounds/coliseum 9 ## 5 Auto dealership new/used 6 ## 6 Bank/savings and loan 21 3.1.3 Offenders Data The original data table shows the number of offenders for specific race, ethnicity and age. Its column names are: Race/Ethnicity/Age Total We can see that it includes all types of information into one column. Thus, after downloading the excel file, we add one Group column which declares whether the entity is a type of race, ethnicity or age and then transform it into a csv file. The columns in our table now are: Offenders: specific race/ethnicity/age such as White/Hispanic/&lt;18 Num: same as column of Total in the original table Group: can only be race, ethnicity or age ## Offenders Num Group ## 1 White 3,365 Race ## 2 Black/African American 1,532 Race ## 3 American Indian/Alaska Native 68 Race ## 4 Asian 58 Race ## 5 Pacific Islander 22 Race ## 6 Multi Races 425 Race 3.2 Factor Data We collect data for different factors such as household median income, educational level, citizen status, race/ethnicity, political parties of each state, unemployment rate. They are all farmatted such that rows represent states and columns represent measures. We choose and store ‘state-value’ data pairs and combine them with crime data as well as population data. We then merge them all into one csv file called Mixed_data whose rows are states and columns are measures such as median income, education level, etc. All above steps are done in python. ## State Offenses Median.Income Education.Level High_School_Rate Bachelor_Rate ## 1 Alabama 0 51734 30.23 86.2 25.5 ## 2 Alaska 17 75463 49.19 92.8 29.6 ## 3 Arizona 254 62055 42.61 87.1 29.5 ## 4 Arkansas 10 48952 27.9 86.6 23 ## 5 California 1221 80440 50.03 83.3 33.9 ## 6 Colorado 257 77127 67.97 91.7 40.9 ## Citizenship.Status Race.Ethnicity Political.Party Unemployment.Rate Population ## 1 0.980 0.654 Republican 0.030 85670 ## 2 0.971 0.600 Republican 0.062 727792 ## 3 0.926 0.542 Republican 0.049 6395924 ## 4 0.968 0.721 Republican 0.035 2813597 ## 5 0.875 0.364 Democrat 0.040 39502561 ## 6 0.952 0.678 Democrat 0.027 5705335 ## Cost.of.Living ## 1 89.3 ## 2 129.9 ## 3 97 ## 4 86.9 ## 5 151.7 ## 6 105.6 3.3 Time Series Data The source data have hate crimes cases and population covered for each state in one year. We then download excel files including data from 2010 to 2019. For each year’s data table, we only keep columns of the total number of offense cases, state names and population covered. We also calculate hate crime cases per 10k population and add another column to indicate which year the state’s hate crime data is from. Finally, we combine all year’s tables into one csv file. The final transformed table includes values: State Case Population hate_crime_per_10k: Case/(Population/100000) year: 2010, 2011,…, 2019 ## State Case Population hate_crime_per_100k year ## 1 Alabama 0 85670 0.0000000 2019 ## 2 Alaska 17 727792 2.3358322 2019 ## 3 Arizona 254 6395924 3.9712792 2019 ## 4 Arkansas 10 2813597 0.3554169 2019 ## 5 California 1221 39502561 3.0909388 2019 ## 6 Colorado 257 5705335 4.5045558 2019 3.4 D3 Data For the interactive plot we plan to show comparisons of different measures over time between two states. But due to the difficulty of finding historical data for the past ten years, we only find data for median income and hate crime for years between 2010 and 2019. We read the data from source csv files and store ‘state-year-measure’ data pairs for all measures. Then we merge them all into one single csv file with rows representing states and columns representing measures. The whole process is done using python ## State Offenses Population Crime_Rate Median_Income Year ## 1 Alabama 0 85670 0.0000000 56200 2019 ## 2 Alabama 0 1865517 0.0000000 50841 2018 ## 3 Alabama 9 2918324 0.3083962 53049 2017 ## 4 Alabama 17 1013839 1.6767948 50308 2016 ## 5 Alabama 12 1252146 0.9583547 48030 2015 ## 6 Alabama 10 794907 1.2580088 45701 2014 "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Location and Number of Missing Values 4.2 Patterns of Missing values 4.3 Actions on missing/abnormal values", " Chapter 4 Missing values In this part, we study the missing values in our dataset. Having better understanding of missing values helps us to know our dataset better and supports our analysis later. The data files we use are: BiasMotivation.csv location.csv Offenders.csv Mixed_data.csv year.csv d3_data.csv 4.1 Location and Number of Missing Values We have a look at each data file to see whether there exist some missing values. If the answer is yes, then we will show the location and the number of missing values in this data file. First, given a data file, we show how many missing values are in each column. In ‘BiasMotivation.csv’ file, ## Bias_motivation Incidents Category ## 0 0 0 There is no missing value in this file. In ‘location.csv’ file, ## Location Num ## 0 0 There is no missing value in this file. In ‘Offenders.csv’ file, ## Offenders Num Group ## 0 0 0 There is no missing value in this file. In ‘Mixed_data.csv’ file, ## State Offenses Median.Income Education.Level ## 0 1 0 2 ## High_School_Rate Bachelor_Rate Citizenship.Status Race.Ethnicity ## 2 2 0 0 ## Political.Party Unemployment.Rate Population Cost.of.Living ## 1 0 1 2 There are eleven missing values in the data file. There are two NAs in education level/high_school_rate/bachelor_rate/cost of living and one in offenses cases/political party/population. Next, we hope to know where these missing values are. This graph shows us clearly where NAs are in the data. Since the source data about cost of living and education which includes variables Education.level, Bachelor_Rate and High_School_Rate only talks about states in the U.S., District of Columbia as a federal district and Puerto Rico as a major territory do not have values for these four variables. Puerto Rico’s values for offenses, political party and population are missing. This is also because that Puerto Rico is a major territory of the U.S. and the source data of hate crimes does not include data for that. In ‘year.csv’ file, ## State Case Population hate_crime_per_100k ## 0 1 1 1 ## year ## 0 There are three missing values in this file. Due to the construction of the data file, ‘geom_tile’ seems to be inefficient and unclear to show the location of missing values. Also, since there are not many missing values in the data file, we decide to print rows including NAs directly. ## # A tibble: 1 x 5 ## State Case Population hate_crime_per_100k year ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 New Jersey NA NA NA 2012 It shows that New Jersey in 2012 has no data for its hate crime cases, population covered and of course the hate crime rate per 100k. In ‘d3_data.csv’ file, ## State Offenses Population Crime_Rate Median_Income Year ## 0 1 1 1 0 0 As this file includes all information in ‘year.csv’ file and just adds one more column about income, we realize that the three missing values are missing information of New Jersey in 2012 in ‘year.csv’ file. The row including NAs printed below confirm our ideas. ## # A tibble: 1 x 6 ## State Offenses Population Crime_Rate Median_Income Year ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 New Jersey NA NA NA 74399 2012 Therefore, we will not plot the missing patterns of this file since this is redundant and meaningless. 4.2 Patterns of Missing values As ‘Mixed_data.csv’ and ‘year.csv’ have missing values, here we will explore patterns of missing values in the two files. In ‘Mixed_data.csv’ file, The graph shows that there are three missing patterns in the ‘Mixed_data.csv’. The most frequent one is that no data is missing. The remaining two patterns are: One case has missing values in four columns Education.level, Bachelor_Rate, High_School_Rate and Cost.of.Living. One case has missing values in seven columns Education.level, Bachelor_Rate, High_School_Rate, Cost.of.Living, Offenses, Political.Party and Population. In ‘year.csv’ file, The graph shows that there are two missing patterns in the ‘Mixed_data.csv’. The most frequent one is that no data is missing. The remaining one is that one has missing values in three columns Case, Population and hate_crime_per_100k. 4.3 Actions on missing/abnormal values It can be noticed that in the mixed data file, Puerto Rico losts most of its data, including hate crime data. Thus it cannot provide any useful information to the analysis. After consideration, we decide to remove Puerto Rico from the dataset. The District of Columbia, on the one hand, losts its educational data, on the other hand, has an unusual high crime rate(number of hate crime cases per 100k population). After drawing boxplot of the data we conclude that data from District of Columbia is an extreme outlier. Taking into consideration of District of Columbia’s demographics, geography and unique criminal justice system as well as the fact that District of Columbia is literaly a city not a state, we believe that District of Columbia is not a proper representation of state crime info and remove it from the dataset. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 How do US hate crimes look like in 2019? 5.2 How do a state’s socioeconomic factors influence its hate crime in 2019? 5.3 How do hate crimes change in US from 2010 to 2019?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 How do US hate crimes look like in 2019? First and foremost, in order to have a rough understanding of 2019’s US hate crimes, we explore the aspects of hate crimes’ locations, offenders and bias motivation in the U.S. in 2019. 5.1.1 Locations of hate crimes The plot above shows that the locations where hate crimes happened most frequently in 2019 are victims’ homes. Home, a place that usually gives people a feeling of peace and security, is actually a place where crimes happen frequently. It may partially because that home is the easiest place to locate a victim. Also, hate crimes against properties are also likely to happen near home. This observation reminds us to pay attention to security problems even when we are at home. Other places that hate crimes may often happen are streets, highways, roads and sidewalks. A school is also a location that hate crimes occur frequently, which makes sense as it includes people from all kinds of races and ethnicities. Hate crimes not often occur in places such as tribal lands, docks and gambling facilities. 5.1.2 Offenders of hate crimes These bar charts show information of known offenders about their races, ethnicities and ages. For races, most offenders are White and then Black/African Americans. For ethnicities, most offenders do not provide their ethnicities. Most of the rest are not Hispanic or Latino. All these match the distributions of people’s races and ethnicities in the US. For ages, the majority are equal to or greater than eighteen years old, but it is still noticeable that there are around 1000 hate crimes conducted by people under eighteen. 5.1.3 Bias motivations behind hate crimes The graph above shows the distribution of bias motivation in 2019. We can see that the motivations for hate are as diverse as the people who form the racial, religious, and mixed-gender melting pot that is the United States of America. There are six main types of bias motivation including Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry/Bias, Religion, Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, Disability and Gender, of which the largest proportion is Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry Bias that accounts for more than 50% of all hate crimes in 2019. This suggests that bias between different races is the main cause of most hate crimes. In addition, different religious beliefs may also lead to some hate crimes, which may be due to the exclusivity of some religious beliefs to some extend. The bias motivation of hate crime are not only towards some specific minorities, it exists anywhere between many different groups. 5.2 How do a state’s socioeconomic factors influence its hate crime in 2019? In this part, we look at each state’s hate crimes in detail and try to find what influences a state’s hate crimes. 5.2.1 Hate crimes by States in 2019 This is the plot that shows 2019’s hate crime cases per 100k population in each state. It seems that there is no specific pattern here. WA has the highest value of hate crime cases per 100k population around 9 and then NM. States such as OR and NJ have relatively high values of hate crime cases per 100k population while states such as AR and AL have relatively low values of hate crime cases per 100k population which almost equal to zero in 2019. All states have values of hate crime cases between 0 and 10. There is no specific geographic pattern of hate crime over states. 5.2.2 Factors that may influence hate crimes Then, several factors are chosen and we hope to find out whether there exist some relationships between hate crime and these factors. We use hate crime rate i.e. hate crime cases per 100k population to represent hate crimes and the factors we explore below are median annual household income, education level, citizenship status (the proportion of citizens), race/ethnicity (the proportion of the white), unemployment rate and political party (Republican or Democrat) of each state. The plot above shows a overall conditions of all factors and hate crime rate grouped by political party. It is really hard to see any specific distribution, cluster or group of hate crime rate directly in this plot. Every state has its own political, social and economic situations, which makes their values for all variables distinct. Thus, we then build a matrix of plots that can provides us with correlation information between any two numeric variables below. Since we are mainly interested in the relationship between hate crime rate and factors, the first row of this matrix of plots is most important here. From the first row, we find out that median income, education level and unemployment rate are positively correlated with hate crime rate while citizen status and race/ethnicity are negatively correlated with hate crime rate. Although the strength of all correlations are not very strong since the largest one is around +0.3 and the smallest one is almost zero, it may still be valuable to explore those interesting correlations in more details. Therefore, we carefully study the relationship between hate crime rate and each factor in the following part. 5.2.2.1 Education In this part, we study the possible relationship between education level and hate crime. People usually associate a high level of education with a low crime rate in our subconscious mind but the result shown in the plot above is somewhat surprising. Except for a few points, as the level of education increases, the hate crime rate also has an increasing trend. The obvious positive slope of the smooth line also shows that from this graph, education level and hate crime rate are positively correlated. Since education level is a relatively overall factor and we hope to have a deeper understanding of this factor, we decompose the educational factor into high school graduation rate and undergraduate rate to explore the influence of basic education and higher education on crime rate. In this plot, it is not difficult to see that there is no obvious relationship between the high school education rate and the crime rate. The slope of the smoothing line here is almost zero, which implies that when the high school education rate increases for a state, the hate crime rate still remains at a relatively stable level. From the two graphs on the bachelor rate, especially the Cleveland graph, areas with higher bachelor rates are more likely to have higher crime rates and the smoothing line has a similar slope as one in education level plot. The result also supports our findings before that with higher educational levels, hate crime rates are supposed to be high. The possible reason for this surprising observation might be that with a increasing demand of a college degree in today’s society, individuals with low level of education are not able to earn as much as their college-educated neighbors.This income inequality combined with their identities as a minority group in a state with generally high education level may greatly motivate those less educated people to do hate crimes. 5.2.2.2 Median Income From this plot, we can see that the relationship between household income and hate crime rate is very similar to the relationship between education level and hate crime rate in the previous part. Moreover, from the initial overview of correlations among different variables, it can be seen that the education level and income do have a very strong correlation with a value around 0.86. This provides us with confidence to conclude that similar to education level, median income has a positive correlation with hate crimes. 5.2.2.3 Citizenship Status These two plots display the relationship between citizenship status (the proportion of citizens in a state) and hate crime rate. The best fitting line in the left chart shows a downward trend, which means that as the citizen rate increases, hate crime rate will decrease instead. As for the second heat map, most of the observations are concentrated in the lower right corner, which shows that there are more points at high citizen rate and low crime rate, and confirms that there may be a corresponding negative correlation between them. 5.2.2.4 Race and Ethnicity This picture depicts the race composition(the proportion of white people) and hate crime rate. Even if the race rate keeps increasing, the distribution of hate crime still appears chaotic, which shows that the composition of Race/Ethnicity does not have a relatively intuitive impact on the hate crime rate. 5.2.2.5 Unemployment Rate This graph shows the relationship between unemployment rate and hate crime rate. It can be seen from the best fitting line and the distribution of all points that as the unemployment rate rises, the hate crime rate will also increase slightly, which is consistent with our common sense. 5.2.2.6 Political Party From this boxplot, we can see that in 2019 Republican-led states had lower median value of hate crime cases per 100k population than state governed by Democratic. Also, values of hate crime cases per 100k population in states which governors are democrat are in a larger range while Republican states are concentrated at a relatively low value. Based on that, we may assume that the policy or laws made by Republican may play a better role in eliminating hate crimes. 5.3 How do hate crimes change in US from 2010 to 2019? Finally, by looking at hate crime data in 2010-2019, we hope to see how the number of hate crimes per 100k changes during this decade. 5.3.1 Hate crimes in US in 2010-2019 The plot above shows the 2010-2019’s values of hate crime cases per 100k population in the entire US. The data is presented in a rough “V” shape. The range is between two and three hate crime cases per 100k population. The lowest one (around 2.15) is in 2014 while the highest one is in 2017 (around 2.75). The reason why 2017 has a high value might be that it was a year when presidents changed. 5.3.2 Hate Crimes by States in 2010-2019 The plots above show each state’s hate crime cases per 100k population from 2010 to 2019. It seems that there does not exist a general pattern here.A lot of states such as Illinois and Iowa tend to maintain their levels of hate crimes while some states such as North Dakota and Vermont tend to fluctuate greatly during this decade. Also, most of states fluctuate in a range between 2 and 5 cases per 100k population. Some may have higher values but all states’ values of hate crimes are under 10 cases per 100k population. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Compare crime rate, median income and total cases between different states over time", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Compare crime rate, median income and total cases between different states over time Compare different stuffs Choose the factor you want to compare This interactive plot enables people to choose any two states in US and then choose one of the three factors (total hate crime cases, hate crime cases per 100k and median income) to compare in a much more clear and direct way. As we have shown in the result part, income is one of the key socioeconomic factors that have some correlations with hate crimes. The interactive plot also allows comparison of total hate crime cases in different states. Some states may appear at the very bottom of the plot when comparing total cases because they have relatively low total cases compared to the range of y-axis, which is determined by the maximum value of total cases, 1300+ total cases from California. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion With data of hate crimes in 2019’s US, we gain many insights about the general condition of hate crime on the aspects of its case numbers, occurring locations, offenders and bias motivations. Also, we compare other 2019’s data of some socioeconomic factors with hate crime and discover some possible correlations among them. We realize that not living conditions of a poor quality but of an inequality lead to the occurrence of hate crimes. Moreover, by collecting a decade’s hate crime data by state, we explore the trends of hate crime in the US and also in each state. Finally, the D3 part enables us to compare the ten years’ change of different variables in different states. However, there are still many limitations for our project and many improvements need to be done for future work. The source data itself has many limitations. Due to the particularity of the definition of hate crime, it requires voluntary participation of multiple agencies to define it. Therefore, when institutions change, the areas and populations covered by hate crime data will fluctuate, making the data in different periods not very comparable. Also, it could mean that states with law enforcement agencies and residents that are more likely to report hate crimes and hate incidents are overrepresented in these areas. Thus, we hope to collect more stable, detailed and comprehensive hate crime data for future work to enrich our data set so that samples will be more representative. When analyzing the factors that may affect hate crime rate, the observations we use are various indicators of states in the United States in one certain year. A insufficient size of samples may cause our conclusions to lack credibility, certainty and representativeness. Hence, in the future, we will take more factors into consideration and verify the conclusions with data at different time points. "]]
